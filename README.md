# 🍽️ GoFood – Food Ordering Web Application

GoFood is a full-stack food ordering web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows users to browse food items, manage their cart, place orders, and view order history. Admins can manage menu items and monitor orders. The project focuses on seamless synchronization between the front-end and back-end using RESTful APIs and JWT authentication.
